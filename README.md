# Tableau Simplex Algorithm

The project implements the Tableau method of the Simplex Algorithm to solve a linear programming problem. It uses the tableau structure to solve the equations to get the optimized solution to the problem. Some sample problems (given in the end of program) are solved using the coded implementation.
